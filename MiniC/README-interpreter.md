`make test-interpret FILTER='TypingAndInterpret/tests/provided/examples/test_print_int.c'` for a single run

`make test` to test all the files in `*/tests/*` according to `EXPECTED` results.

You can select the files you want to test by using `make test FILTER='TypingAndInterpret/**/*bad*.c'` (`**` means
"any number of possibly nested directories").
